            Among her peers, Lottie has always had a reputation for her hair. Her look is always
            changing as she experiments with new colors and combinations. In public, strangers often
            approach her to compliment the bold style. After years of coloring her own hair, she
            found this was something she wants to pursue and share with others.

            With a passion for working in the screen and stage industry, Lottie finds inspiration in

            With the threat of Covid, SFIEC has been holding online classes for the majority of the
            year. From her home, Lottie practices on the hair of model dolls. She looks forward to
            returning back to school in person to train and collaborate with her fellow creative
            minded peers. In May, she will graduate from the program and begin her career as makeup
            artist and hair styling. Follow her Instagram to stay up to date on her work.
