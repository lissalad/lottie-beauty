              Meet Lottie Thorsen, artist of makeup and hair. Lottie is currently in school learning
              all about hair, makeup and skin at the San Francisco Institute of Esthetics &
              Cosmetology (SFIEC). Her primary focus is in theatrical makeup and color specialty.
              She loves SFX and prosthetic work. She intends to work in the stage and screen
              industry.

              Among her peers, Lottie has always had a reputation for her hair. Her look is always
              changing as she experiments with new colors and combinations. In public, strangers
              often approach her to compliment the bold style. After years of coloring her own hair,
              she found this was something she wants to pursue and share with others.

            appreciated the ______ makeup. In contrast, the makeup in the film Repo! The Genetic

            With the threat of Covid, SFIEC has been holding online classes for the majority of the
            year. From her home, Lottie practices on the hair of model dolls. She looks forward to
            returning back to school in person to train and collaborate with her fellow creative
            minded peers. In May, she will graduate from the program and begin her career as makeup
            artist and hair styling. Follow her Instagram to stay up to date on her work.
